# HiRE - Hiring for a Better Earth

**HiRE** is a platform under the **Society of Renewable Energy (SRE)** that is dedicated to searching, preparing, and providing information about **green jobs**. HiRE recently organized a series of events called Career Fair, which included webinars and a virtual career fair.

## Project Links
- **ðŸš€ Production**: [https://www.sre-hireidn.com/](https://www.sre-hireidn.com/)
- **ðŸ”§ Development**: [https://sre-hireidn-migrate.vercel.app/](https://sre-hireidn-migrate.vercel.app/)

## Project Mission

The purpose of these events was to allow the younger generation to explore information about **job vacancies** and **career preparation**. Additionally, HiRE provides information on internships in various companies. The main focus is to facilitate the search for information on green jobs in order to **prevent environmental damage**.

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Development (UI Implementation)

**Design Implementation**: Translated UI/UX team's high-fidelity Figma designs into fully responsive and accessible UI using **React (Next.js)** with **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**. Collaborated closely with dedicated UI/UX designer to ensure pixel-perfect implementation.

**Critical Page Implementation**:
- **Landing Page**: Hero section, testimonials, call-to-action components
- **Course Listing Page**: Advanced filtering, pagination, responsive grid layout
- **Learning Dashboard**: Progress tracking, navigation, integrated video player
- **Course Detail Page**: Comprehensive syllabus, instructor information, enrollment logic
- **Career Page**: Job listings, application forms, candidate management

### Advanced Routing & Dynamic Content

**Next.js Architecture**: Utilized **file-based routing** and **dynamic routing** to support course detail pages with SEO optimization. Managed client-side navigation and conditional rendering using TypeScript props and states for enhanced user experience.

### CI/CD & Deployment Leadership

**Vercel Pipeline Management**: Took complete ownership of **CI/CD workflow using Vercel**, including preview deployment per branch, environment variable management, and automated production release pipeline. Ensured build success across environments and handled staging/production branching strategies.

**Backend Collaboration**: Worked with backend team using Firebase, focusing on frontend integration while the backend team handled Firebase architecture and data management.

### Code Quality & Development Standards

**Type Safety & Tooling**: Enforced rigorous code quality standards using **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **TypeScript strict types**. Applied type safety in API integration and props/state management for better developer experience and fewer runtime errors.

**Cross-Team Collaboration**: Worked with dedicated UI/UX designer for design implementation and collaborated with backend team managing Firebase architecture, while taking full ownership of Vercel CI/CD pipeline and frontend development.
