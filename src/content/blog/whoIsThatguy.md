# Web 3PL – Frontend & UI Ownership in Multi-Modal Logistics

My first deep dive into **3PL (Third-Party Logistics)** industry, working directly with **land and air transportation partners**. This project opened up entirely new domain knowledge in logistics operations and multi-modal shipping coordination.

## Industry Learning Experience

**New Territory**: First time working in 3PL logistics domain, learning complex shipping workflows, partner integration processes, and multi-modal transportation coordination between land and air carriers.

**Partner Integration**: Collaborated directly with various transportation partners - both **land carriers** (trucking companies, rail freight) and **air carriers** (cargo airlines, freight forwarders) to understand their operational requirements and system integration needs.

## Design-to-Code Journey

**Custom UI Design**: Created the entire interface from scratch specifically for 3PL operations. No existing logistics templates - designed unique workflows for partner onboarding, shipment coordination, and multi-modal tracking.

**Iterative Design Process**: Extensive discussions with logistics stakeholders, transportation partners, and operations teams. Multiple design iterations to accommodate complex 3PL workflows and partner-specific requirements.

**Precision Implementation**: Hand-coded every component for logistics-specific use cases - from partner dashboards to shipment coordination interfaces, ensuring seamless integration between land and air transportation modes.

## What Makes This Project Special

- **First 3PL Experience**: Deep dive into logistics industry and multi-modal transportation
- **Partner Collaboration**: Direct work with land and air transportation partners
- **Domain Expertise**: Gained comprehensive understanding of 3PL operations and workflows  
- **Multi-Modal Innovation**: Created unified platform for cross-transportation coordination
- **Industry Impact**: Streamlined logistics operations for complex supply chain management
