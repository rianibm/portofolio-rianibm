# Perkantas Yogyakarta – Community-Based Web Platform

I worked on the **design-to-code implementation and development** of the **Perkantas Yogyakarta web platform**, a community-based system supporting **Christian discipleship activities** for students, alumni, and medical professionals.

This project marked my **first full-cycle freelance experience**, where I was involved from early discussions through development and post-launch maintenance.

---

## Context & Project Scope

Perkantas Yogyakarta required a web platform to manage community activities, internal resources, and administrative workflows. The platform needed to be accessible across devices and simple enough to be used by a wide range of users with varying technical familiarity.

From the start, the project emphasized **clarity, maintainability, and long-term usability** over complex interactions.

---

## Full-Cycle Freelance Experience

**End-to-End Involvement**  
I was involved throughout the full project lifecycle, including requirement discussions, implementation, testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. This provided early exposure to real-world constraints such as changing requirements, stakeholder feedback, and production stability.

**Client Communication**  
Worked directly with non-technical stakeholders, translating functional needs into implementable features and aligning expectations around scope and timelines.

---

## Frontend & UI Implementation

**Design-to-Code Execution**  
While UI designs were not created by me, I collaborated closely during the design phase, providing technical input on feasibility and responsive behavior. I then translated approved designs into production-ready interfaces using **Laravel Blade** and **Bootstrap**.

**Responsive Layouts**  
Implemented responsive layouts to ensure the platform could be accessed comfortably on desktop and mobile devices, focusing on readability and straightforward navigation.

**Component-based Structure**  
Structured the frontend using reusable Blade components to improve consistency and maintainability across the platform.

---

## Backend Exposure & Feature Development

**User & Admin Modules**  
Implemented core features such as user management and admin functionality, integrating frontend views with backend logic using Laravel.

**Book Borrowing Feature**  
Developed a book borrowing workflow allowing users to browse available resources and submit loan requests through the platform.

**Email Notification System (First Experience)**  
Built my first email notification feature to notify admins of book loan requests. This required learning Laravel’s email system and understanding how notifications behave in a production environment.

---

## Production & Maintenance Experience

**Live Platform Responsibility**  
Gained hands-on experience maintaining a live system, including handling minor bug fixes, improving UI clarity, and ensuring ongoing platform stability after launch.

**Clean Structure & Maintainability**  
Maintained organized project structure, scoped styles, and consistent layouts to support future updates and easier maintenance.
