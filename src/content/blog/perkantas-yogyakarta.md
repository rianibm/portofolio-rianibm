# Perkantas Yogyakarta – Community-Based Web Platform

Perkantas Yogyakarta is a **community-based web platform** built to support Christian discipleship activities for students, alumni, and medical professionals.

I worked on this project primarily as a **frontend developer**, focusing on turning agreed requirements into a usable and maintainable interface. This was also my **first freelance project**, which meant the work extended beyond code into long-term responsibility for the live platform.

---

## Project Context

The platform was designed to support internal community activities, shared resources, and simple administrative workflows. Users came from varied backgrounds and technical familiarity, so the interface needed to be straightforward, readable, and accessible across devices.

From the beginning, the focus was not on visual complexity, but on **clarity, stability, and ease of use** for a real community.

---

## Role & Responsibilities

**Frontend-focused Work**  
My core responsibility was on frontend implementation.
- Translating approved designs into working interfaces
- Implementing responsive layouts using Laravel Blade and Bootstrap
- Structuring reusable layout components to keep the UI consistent and maintainable

I was involved in ERD discussions to understand data structure and flows, but I did not design the database nor implement backend architecture.

UI designs were provided externally. My role was to ensure those designs could be implemented cleanly and worked well across screen sizes.

---

## Platform & Operational Responsibility

Beyond development, I handled several operational aspects of the platform:
- Domain setup and management
- Hosting configuration
- Email service configuration for platform notifications
- Ongoing maintenance and small fixes after launch
This meant being responsible not just for shipping the site, but for keeping it running over time. Maintenance work is still handled when needed.

---

## What This Project Taught Me

- How frontend decisions affect real users in a live system
- Communicating with non-technical stakeholders clearly and patiently
- Owning a project beyond delivery, including post-launch stability
- Understanding system boundaries without overstepping them

---

## Key Takeaways

- First freelance project with real user
- Frontend-focused role with long-term ownership
- Exposure to production environments and maintenance work
- Building technology to support a community, not a product demo

Specific implementation details are kept high-level to respect community and platform boundaries.
