# HiRE – Green Jobs Platform

I worked on the **frontend implementation** of **HiRE**, a web platform under the **Society of Renewable Energy (SRE)** that provides information about **green jobs, internships, and career preparation**.

This project marked my **first production experience using Next.js**, where I was responsible for translating designs into a production-ready frontend and managing the deployment workflow.

---

## Context & Project Scope

HiRE was built to support a series of career-related initiatives, including webinars and a virtual career fair, aimed at helping younger generations explore opportunities in sustainability-focused careers.

From a frontend perspective, the platform needed to be:
- accessible across devices  
- content-driven and easy to navigate  
- ready for public-facing production use  

---

## Frontend & UI Implementation

**Design-to-Code Execution**  
Worked closely with a UI/UX designer to translate high-fidelity Figma designs into responsive and accessible UI using **React (Next.js)**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

The implementation focused on maintaining layout consistency, visual clarity, and usability across different screen sizes.

**Key Pages Implemented**
- **Landing Page** — hero sections, testimonials, and call-to-action components  
- **Career Page** — job listings and application-related views  
- **Course Listing & Detail Pages** — structured content layout, pagination, and detail views  
- **Learning Dashboard** — navigation and progress-oriented layout  

---

## Routing & Page Structure

**Next.js Routing**  
Utilized **file-based routing** and **dynamic routes** to support content-driven pages while keeping URLs SEO-friendly.

**State & Conditional Rendering**  
Handled UI states and conditional rendering to ensure smooth navigation and clear feedback across different user flows.

---

## Deployment & Development Workflow

**Vercel Deployment**  
Managed deployment using **Vercel**, including preview deployments for development branches and production releases. Handled environment variable configuration and ensured builds were stable across environments.

**Backend Integration Awareness**  
Collaborated with the backend team using **Firebase**, focusing on frontend integration while backend logic and data handling were managed separately.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **First production project using Next.js**
- **Strong design-to-code frontend implementation**
- **Hands-on experience with dynamic routing and SEO-friendly pages**
- **Ownership of deployment workflow using Vercel**
- **Collaboration with UI/UX and backend teams**
- **Building a public-facing platform for sustainability-focused initiatives**
