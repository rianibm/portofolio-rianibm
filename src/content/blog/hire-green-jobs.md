# HiRE – Green Jobs Platform

HiRE is a **public-facing green jobs platform** developed under the **Society of Renewable Energy (SRE)**, aimed at connecting job seekers with opportunities in sustainability-focused careers.

I worked on this project as a **frontend developer**, responsible for implementing production-ready UI, structuring content-driven pages, and supporting deployment to a live environment. This project became my **first real production experience using Next.js**.

---

## Context & Product Scope

HiRE was built to support multiple career initiatives, including job listings, learning resources, webinars, and virtual career events.

From a frontend perspective, the platform needed to:
- scale across content-heavy pages  
- remain accessible and readable on all devices  
- support SEO-friendly public pages  
- feel stable and trustworthy for first-time visitors  

The emphasis was not on experimental UI, but on **clarity, performance, and production readiness**.

---

## Frontend & UI Implementation

**Design-to-Code Execution**  
I worked closely with a UI/UX designer to translate high-fidelity designs into responsive and maintainable interfaces using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

The focus was on:
- layout consistency across pages  
- predictable component behavior  
- clean separation between layout, content, and interaction  

**Key Areas Implemented**
- Landing and campaign pages for public outreach  
- Job and career-related listing and detail pages  
- Learning-related pages with structured navigation  
- Dashboard-style layouts for logged-in users  

Details around internal logic and data handling are intentionally kept at a high level.

---

## Routing, State & Content Handling

**Dynamic Routing & SEO Awareness**  
Implemented dynamic routes for content-driven pages while maintaining clean, SEO-friendly URLs suitable for public indexing.

**UI State & Conditional Rendering**  
Handled various UI states to ensure smooth transitions, clear feedback, and predictable behavior across different user flows, including logged-in and public contexts.

---

## Deployment & Workflow

**Production Deployment**  
Supported deployment to a live production environment, including environment configuration and preview-based release workflows.

**Collaboration with Backend**  
Worked alongside backend engineers handling authentication and data services. My responsibility stayed on frontend integration and presentation, ensuring backend complexity was not exposed to users.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **First production-scale project using Next.js**
- **Strong design-to-code frontend execution**
- **Experience building SEO-friendly, content-heavy pages**
- **Exposure to real production deployment workflows**
- **Collaboration with designers and backend engineers**
- **Building a public platform with real users and visibility**

Specific implementation details are intentionally described at a conceptual level to respect organizational and platform boundaries.
