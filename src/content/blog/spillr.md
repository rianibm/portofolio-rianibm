# Spillr – Decentralized Anonymous Q&A Platform

I worked on the **frontend implementation** of **Spillr**, a decentralized anonymous Q&A platform built on the **Internet Computer (ICP)** ecosystem.

This project was developed during **ICP Hackathon Indonesia 2025**, where our team built a functional MVP in **72 hours** and achieved **2nd place** in the Internet Identity category.

---

## Context & Scope

Spillr was designed to explore how anonymous Q&A interactions could be supported in a decentralized environment. From a frontend perspective, the challenge was to design an interface that feels familiar and easy to use, while operating on top of blockchain-based identity and data storage.

The scope focused on delivering a **usable MVP**, not just a proof-of-concept.

---

## Frontend Responsibilities

**UI Implementation**  
Implemented the frontend using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, focusing on a clean, mobile-first interface that supports anonymous posting and commenting flows.

**Component Architecture**  
Built reusable UI components to support rapid iteration during the hackathon, allowing the team to adjust flows and layouts quickly as requirements evolved.

**Responsive Design**  
Ensured the interface worked reliably across different screen sizes, prioritizing usability under time constraints.

---

## Blockchain Integration Awareness

**Frontend–Blockchain Coordination**  
Worked closely with backend developers implementing smart contract logic in **Motoko**, aligning frontend interactions with blockchain-backed identity and data constraints.

The frontend was designed to:
- reflect anonymous interaction states clearly  
- handle loading and error states from decentralized operations  
- avoid exposing blockchain complexity to end users  

---

## Hackathon Constraints & Collaboration

**72-hour Development Window**  
The entire product was built within a strict 72-hour timeframe, requiring fast decision-making, prioritization, and trade-offs between completeness and usability.

**Cross-functional Teamwork**  
Collaborated with a five-person team covering frontend, blockchain backend, and system architecture, coordinating changes and integration under tight deadlines.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Rapid frontend delivery under extreme time constraints**
- **First hands-on experience with Internet Computer ecosystem**
- **Designing user-friendly UI on top of decentralized systems**
- **Effective collaboration in a cross-functional hackathon team**
- **Building a functional MVP that earned competitive recognition**
