# Sky Explorer - Comprehensive Flight Booking Application

***Under Construction*** ⚠️
*This project was originally built using React with Vite and a separate backend. Since the backend is no longer active, a new version using Next.js is currently in development but **temporarily on hold due to current work commitments**.*

**Sky Explorer** is a comprehensive flight booking application that allows users to search, compare, and book flights with an intuitive interface. This project is my **bootcamp final project**, where **only 2 frontend developers** handled the entire complex application while working full-time jobs - coding exclusively during evening hours in **less than a month**.

## Project Status & Links
- **🔗 Previous Frontend Code**: [View Repository](https://github.com/SkyExplorer-Team/FSW_FE_WEB_USER_NEW)
- **🚧 Next.js Development**: [https://github.com/rianibm/sky-explorer](https://github.com/rianibm/sky-explorer) *(Currently on hold due to work commitments)*

## Development Challenges & Timeline

### Resource Constraints
**2-Person Frontend Team**: Handled the entire complex flight booking application with only 2 frontend developers, requiring efficient task distribution and close collaboration to cover all features and functionality.

**Evening Development Schedule**: All coding work performed during night hours after full-time jobs, demonstrating exceptional time management and dedication. Sessions typically ran late into the night to meet bootcamp deadlines.

### Time Pressure & Dependencies
**Compressed Timeline**: Completed entire frontend in **less than a month** due to design delivery delays, creating intense pressure to deliver production-ready application within limited timeframe.

**Design Dependency**: Development couldn't begin until design completion, resulting in compressed development window that required rapid execution and efficient coding practices.

### Advanced React Architecture
Built scalable flight booking platform with **TypeScript**, implementing complex **multi-step forms (6-step registration)**, dynamic search interfaces, and real-time data processing. Created comprehensive booking flows with proper error boundaries and loading states.

### State Management Excellence  
Implemented global state using **Recoil** for efficient data sharing across components, managing booking flows, user sessions, and notification systems. Handled complex state interactions between search results, user preferences, and booking processes.

### Modern Routing System
Developed file-based routing with **Vite** for automatic route discovery, dynamic parameters, and lazy loading optimization. Implemented protected routes, authentication flows, and seamless navigation patterns.

## User Experience & Interface

### Complex UI Implementation
Created responsive booking interface featuring:
- **Airport Search/Selection** with autocomplete and filtering
- **Advanced Date Pickers** with availability indicators
- **Passenger Management** system with multiple travelers
- **Cabin Class Selection** with price comparison
- **Alternative Date Pricing** modals for flexible booking

### Interactive Components & Animations
Built comprehensive **notification center** with time-based grouping algorithms, pagination system, and custom SVG icon rendering for different notification types. Integrated **Framer Motion** for smooth page transitions and micro-interactions throughout booking flows.

### Component Architecture
Developed reusable component library with proper TypeScript interfaces, custom hooks, and separation of concerns for maintainable codebase. Implemented comprehensive error handling, loading states, and form validation systems.

## API Integration & Performance

### External API Integration
Connected React frontend to external **Express.js** and **Java** backend services, handling authentication, flight search, booking management, and user data synchronization across multiple endpoints.

### Data Processing & Optimization
Implemented client-side filtering, search functionality, date manipulation using **Day.js**, and real-time form validation with custom business logic. Utilized code splitting, lazy loading, and optimized re-rendering patterns for large datasets.

## What Makes This Project Special

- **2-Person Frontend Team**: Only 2 frontend developers handling the entire complex flight booking application
- **Working While Learning**: Developed this comprehensive app while working full-time jobs - coding sessions limited to evening hours
- **Time Pressure**: Completed entire frontend in less than a month due to design delivery delays, requiring intense focus and efficiency
- **Design Dependency**: Had to wait for design completion before starting development, creating compressed timeline pressure
- **Complex Domain with Limited Resources**: Built sophisticated flight booking system with minimal team size and time constraints
- **Evening Development**: All coding work done during night hours after full-time work, demonstrating dedication and time management
- **Rapid Execution**: Successfully delivered production-ready application despite resource and time limitations

> 📌 **Note**: Focused on frontend development and API integration. Backend services (Express.js/Java) were developed by separate team.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **State Management**: Recoil
- **UI Framework**: Ant Design, Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **API**: REST API Integration
- **Performance**: Code Splitting, Lazy Loading
