# Web 3PL – Frontend & UI Ownership in Multi-Modal Logistics
This project was my first exposure to the **3PL (Third-Party Logistics) domain**, working on an **internal web platform** used to support logistics operations involving land and air transportation.

My responsibility focused on the **frontend and UI layer**, translating operational requirements into interfaces that could be used reliably in day-to-day logistics workflows.

## Industry Learning Experience
**Entering the 3PL Domain**
This was my first time working within a 3PL context, requiring an understanding of how logistics operations differ between land and air transportation, including workflow sequencing and operational dependencies.

Rather than working from predefined templates, the UI was shaped based on actual operational needs and existing processes.

**Working with Partners**
The platform supports coordination with transportation partners across different modes. My work involved understanding how these partners interact with the system and reflecting those needs in the UI structure and information layout.

## Design-to-Code Journey
**Custom UI for Operational Use**
The interface was designed specifically for internal logistics workflows, covering partner-related views, shipment coordination screens, and operational dashboards. The focus was clarity and usability rather than visual complexity.

**Iterative Adjustments**
UI decisions were refined through discussions with stakeholders and operations teams, with multiple iterations to accommodate real usage patterns and edge cases.

**Frontend Implementation**
All components were implemented with logistics-specific scenarios in mind, ensuring the UI could handle data-heavy views and multi-step workflows in a consistent and predictable way.

## What Makes This Project Special
- First hands-on experience in 3PL logistics
- Exposure to multi-modal transportation workflows
- Frontend ownership for internal operational tools
= Design-to-code implementation for data-heavy interfaces
- Focus on usability for daily logistics operations
