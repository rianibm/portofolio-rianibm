# Dashboard Member Plus – Frontend & UX Engineering for Seller Operations
Dashboard Member Plus is a **seller-facing management platform** designed to support **daily operational workflows**, including package monitoring, tier progression, referral tracking, and seller profile management.

This platform is built for **real production usage**, handling data-heavy views and recurring interactions from active sellers.

My responsibility focused on the **frontend and UX layer**, translating business rules and operational requirements into interfaces that are clear, scalable, and reliable for everyday use.

## Industry & Product Context
**Working in Seller Operations**
This project required a deep understanding of how sellers interact with operational systems on a daily basis, including package submission, performance tracking, and incentive progression.

The UI needed to support **frequent usage**, fast scanning of information, and clear feedback for seller actions.

Rather than prioritizing visual flair, the interface was shaped around **clarity, hierarchy, and efficiency**, aligning with how sellers actually use the system.

## Operational & Incentive Workflows
**Tiering and Referral System**
Dashboard Member Plus includes a tiering system based on seller activity, such as AWB submission and transaction history, as well as a referral mechanism tied to incentive earnings.

From a frontend perspective, this involved:
- structuring multi-step operational flows
- presenting progression and rewards transparently
- ensuring sellers could understand their current status at a glance

The UI needed to balance **gamification elements** with operational seriousness, without distracting from core tasks.

## Design-to-Code Journey
**Operational-Focused UI**
The interface was designed specifically for seller operations, covering dashboard analytics, tiering views, referral summaries, and transaction history.

The focus was on:
- clear information hierarchy
- reusable UI components
- layouts that remain usable even with large datasets

**Iterative Refinement**
UI decisions were refined through:
- collaboration with stakeholders
- feedback from real usage scenarios
- iterative improvements to reduce friction in seller workflows

**Frontend Implementation**
All components were implemented using a component-based architecture, ensuring:
- consistency across features
- maintainable code structure
- scalability as business rules evolved
